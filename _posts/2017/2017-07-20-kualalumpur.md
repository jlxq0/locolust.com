After my adventures in the [Philippines]({% post_url 2017/2017-06-26-philippines %}), I found myself truly solo for the first time, with Philipp no longer around even for guest appearances. My next destination was Kuala Lumpur, kicking off with a budget AirAsia flight from Manila to KLIA2. This flight reminded me why I love train travel so much. The endless queues, the strict weight limits for carry-on luggage, and the overall hassle made me yearn for the simplicity and comfort of a train journey. But alas, for international travel, flights are often the only viable option.

## Arrival in Kuala Lumpur

Landing in Kuala Lumpur was smooth, and I was eager to reconnect with Misha and Verena, friends I met on the train to Mongolia. They were staying at a hostel that cost a mere six dollars a night, the cheapest accommodation I'd ever experienced. The hostel was basic, but it worked. I had a bed in a four or six-bed dorm, and for that price, I couldn't complain.

The next morning, we decided to explore the city together. Our first stop was breakfast at The Red Bean Bag, a delightful spot with amazing crab cakes and various egg dishes. It's a place I highly recommend if it still exists. After breakfast, we visited a nearby mosque and then took a short taxi ride to the Chow Kit wet market.

## A Colorful Market Experience

Chow Kit wet market is one of my favorite markets. It's vibrant, fresh, and incredibly colorful. We were offered samples of fruits and other local produce by friendly vendors, making for a delightful and filling experience. The market also has a large meat and seafood section, which, while intense in smell, offers a fascinating glimpse into local food culture. It's a bit of a sensory overload but in the best way possible.

After the market, we ventured to a nearby street food spot and decided to try durian for the first time. For those unfamiliar, durian is a notoriously smelly fruit, banned from public transport and hotels in many places. Our reactions were mixed, to say the least. The taste is a peculiar blend of fruity and garlicky, with a custardy texture. Over time, I've grown to appreciate it, much like one might develop a taste for wine or whiskey.

## Exploring the Cityscape

We continued our exploration of Kuala Lumpur by visiting KLCC, home to the iconic Petronas Towers. The area is a bustling hub with a convention center, a subway station, and a massive shopping mall. Outside, there's a park offering great views of the towers and a constant stream of vendors trying to sell wide-angle lenses for your phone.

From KLCC, we walked to Pavilion, another huge shopping center with a food court, shops, and sometimes exhibitions. We ended our day at Din Tai Fung, enjoying some of the best dumplings around. I also bought a new day pack, a small red Pacsafe backpack that would become my trusty companion for the rest of my Southeast Asia trip.

## A Night Out in Kuala Lumpur

Our evening took an unexpected turn as we decided to experience the local nightlife. We started at a billiard cafe, playing with locals and enjoying a few beers. When the cafe closed, we tried to enter a club but were turned away due to one of us wearing flip-flops. Undeterred, we found another spot and continued our night out. It was a fantastic evening filled with laughter and camaraderie.

However, we hit a snag when we lost our hostel keys and couldn't find anyone to let us in. We ended up booking a room at a nearby hotel, which wasn't the nicest but served its purpose. The next day, Misha and Verena left for Tioman Island, while I stayed in Kuala Lumpur for another day, catching up on sleep and exploring more of the city.

## Journey to Tioman Island

The following morning, I took a bus from Kuala Lumpur to Mersing, the departure point for ferries to Tioman Island. Tioman is a simple, beautiful island on the east coast of Malaysia, known for its clear waters and great diving spots. The journey to the island was an adventure in itself, involving a steep and winding mountain road that can only be traversed by jeep.

Our accommodation on Tioman was basic but comfortable. The island's beauty more than made up for the lack of luxury. We spent our days exploring, including a memorable hike through the jungle to a waterfall. The hike was challenging but rewarding, leading to a stunning series of mountain streams and rocks where we spent hours playing and enjoying the natural beauty.

## Final Days on Tioman

On our last day, we experienced the island's unique charm, including a handmade ferry crossing over a river and a night of skinny dipping in the ocean. We rented scooters and explored the island, making the most of our time before catching the ferry back to the mainland.

The journey back was a bit rushed, as I had a flight to catch from Johor Bahru International Airport. My driver, sensing my urgency, sped through the winding roads, making for a nauseating but timely arrival at the airport. From there, I flew to Penang, ready to continue my Southeast Asian adventure.

## Looking Ahead

Penang was just the next stop on a journey that would take me through Thailand, including Ko Tao and [Bangkok]({% post_url 2017/2017-07-26-georgetown %}), and eventually the famous pancake trail followed by many backpackers. But those stories are for another time.
