After wrapping up my adventures in [Kuala Lumpur]({% post_url 2017/2017-07-20-kualalumpur %}) and Tioman Island, I found myself on a short flight to Georgetown, Penang. I landed late, but that didn’t stop me from diving straight into the heart of the city’s famed street food scene. Georgetown, with its colonial charm, old buildings, and vibrant street art, felt like a step back in time. It’s a city that wears its history on its sleeve, much like the old parts of Singapore or Malacca.

## A Night in Georgetown

Despite the late hour, the streets were alive with the aroma of local delicacies. I indulged in everything from char kway teow to Penang laksa, savoring each bite. The city’s colonial architecture, combined with its bustling night markets, created an atmosphere that was both nostalgic and electrifying. After filling up on street food, I found myself at a karaoke bar, belting out tunes with locals and fellow travelers. It was a perfect introduction to the city.

I stayed at Palm Mansions, an Airbnb nestled in an old colonial shophouse. The wooden ceilings and vintage decor transported me to another era, making it one of the most charming places I’ve ever stayed. The next morning, I revisited an old favorite, the Magshaft Café, for breakfast. I had fond memories of this place from a previous trip with my friend Hatim.

## Exploring Penang’s Natural Beauty

Post-breakfast, I rented a scooter and set off to explore the northern part of the island. Penang’s natural beauty is often overshadowed by its urban attractions, but it’s equally captivating. I ventured through lush jungles and pristine beaches, capturing stunning photos along the way. The island’s tranquility was a stark contrast to the bustling streets of Georgetown.

My time in Penang was short but sweet. I took a car ferry back to the mainland, standing between vehicles and soaking in the ocean views. From there, I caught a train to the northern border of Malaysia, aiming to cross into Thailand. This border crossing is a peculiar one, opening only twice a day. I spent a considerable amount of time waiting, but the anticipation added to the adventure.

## Crossing Into Thailand

Once in Thailand, I boarded a train bound for Chumphon, a familiar route reminiscent of a previous journey with Hatim. From Chumphon, I took an overnight boat to Koh Tao. This boat was a relic from another time, with no cabins or compartments, just a large upper deck lined with mattresses. It was a communal experience, with locals and travelers alike sharing stories and snacks.

The boat ride was slow and serene, the perfect antidote to the fast-paced travel I’d been experiencing. I stayed up late, observing the locals and their relaxed approach to life. When I finally fell asleep, the gentle rocking of the boat lulled me into a deep slumber. I woke up to the sight of Koh Tao at sunrise, a sight that will forever be etched in my memory.

## Koh Tao: A Slice of Paradise

Koh Tao was my first Thai island experience, and it didn’t disappoint. I was picked up by my hotel in a pickup truck, a thrilling ride that took me up and down the island’s hilly terrain. My hotel, perched on the cliffs, offered breathtaking views of the bay and a tiny island in the distance.

One of my first stops was Hippo Burger Bistro for lunch. The burger was decent, but the real highlight was renting a scooter to explore the island. The freedom of zipping around on two wheels, especially up the steep path to my hotel, was exhilarating. I spent three blissful days on Koh Tao, a mix of relaxation and adventure. I even went snorkeling, a rare activity for me, but the clear waters and vibrant marine life made it worthwhile.

Leaving Koh Tao was bittersweet. I took a ferry back to Surat Thani and then a train to Bangkok. My first night in Bangkok was a stark contrast to the tranquility of Koh Tao. I stayed near Khao San Road, a notorious backpacker haven. The wild party atmosphere was fun at first, but it quickly turned sour. I lost my phone, a brand-new iPhone I had bought in Japan, and woke up the next morning with a terrible headache and a sense of regret.

## Bangkok: A City of Contrasts

Determined to turn things around, I bought a new phone and set out to explore Bangkok. I switched to a nicer hotel and spent my days sightseeing. I visited the Chatuchak market with friends Verena and Misha, explored the Grand Palace, and took a cheap river boat to get a different perspective of the city. One evening, I met a fellow traveler through Couchsurfing, and we ventured up a skyscraper for a panoramic view of Bangkok at sunset.

One of the highlights was meeting my old colleague, Steffan, who was also in Bangkok for work. We had a memorable evening at the train market, enjoying a seafood feast where the food was served directly on the table. It was a nostalgic and heartwarming reunion.

My time in Bangkok was a mix of highs and lows, but it ended on a positive note. After a few days of exploring and reconnecting with friends, I was ready for my next adventure. I took a flight to [Hanoi]({% post_url 2017/2017-08-02-hanoi %}), eager to experience the charm of Vietnam.
