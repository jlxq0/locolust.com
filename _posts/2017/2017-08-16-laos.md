## The Flight to Luang Prabang

My journey from [Cambodia]({% post_url 2017/2017-08-13-siemreap %}) to Laos was already an adventure in itself. Picture this: a tiny prop plane with about 30 to 40 passengers, and a boarding pass that was essentially a laminated piece of paper with a removable marker for the seat number. It was charmingly low-tech and eco-friendly. The flight itself was bumpy and low-flying, offering stunning aerial views of the lush green landscapes and the serpentine Mekong River, a muddy brown ribbon cutting through the greenery. It was August 2017, and the scenery was as captivating as it was untouched by civilization.

## First Impressions of Luang Prabang

Landing in Luang Prabang felt like stepping back in time. The airport was small but functional, and I quickly made my way to my hostel. It was a simple, unremarkable place, but it served its purpose well. After a quick shower and some rest, I ventured out to explore the local market. This market, I can assure you, has remained unchanged even as recently as last year. It's a bustling hub of street food vendors offering an array of Laotian snacks. While Laotian cuisine may not be my favorite, the market's offerings were quite decent. From various types of spring rolls to barbecued meats, the food was a delightful introduction to what Laos had to offer.

## The Enigmatic Cuisine of Laos

One thing that struck me was how Laotian cuisine hasn't achieved the international fame that Thai or Vietnamese food has. You can find Thai and Vietnamese restaurants in almost every major city around the world, but Laotian, Cambodian, and Burmese cuisines remain largely confined to their countries of origin. This is puzzling, given the rich flavors and unique dishes that these countries offer. Despite this, the street food in Luang Prabang's market was enjoyable. I even had a memorable meal at Cafe Thuy, where the service was warm and the food was quite good. I had spring rolls, curry, and mango sticky rice for dessert, all of which were satisfying.

## The Majestic Waterfalls of Luang Prabang

The next day was dedicated to sightseeing, and I joined some fellow travelers from my hostel for a trip to the famous Luang Prabang waterfalls. We took a public mini-van to get there, and the journey itself was an adventure. The waterfalls were breathtaking, cascading down multiple levels and surrounded by lush jungle greenery. I tried my hand at long-exposure photography to capture the soft, white flow of the water, but my amateur equipment and some water droplets on the lens resulted in less-than-perfect shots. Nevertheless, the experience was unforgettable.

Hiking up to the top of the waterfalls, a short 10-20 minute trek, revealed a series of natural pools where people were swimming and relaxing. There was even a small kiosk selling drinks, adding to the laid-back atmosphere. This idyllic scene was a stark contrast to a later visit with my buddy Hatim, where the pools were disappointingly dried out and swarming with mosquitoes. It just goes to show how much natural attractions can change with the seasons.

## Exploring the Town and Meeting Fellow Travelers

Back in Luang Prabang, I explored the town's numerous Buddha statues and enjoyed panoramic views from a hilltop. The town itself felt more like a village, with its small houses and serene atmosphere. One evening, I encountered what I like to call "professional backpackers"â€”those who treat backpacking as a competitive sport. These folks often brag about spending the least amount of money, staying in the cheapest hostels, and enduring the most hardships. While their stories can be entertaining, I prefer a more balanced approach to travel.

## Reflecting on the Journey

On my last day in Luang Prabang, I had what I can only describe as the worst breakfast of my life. It was so bad that it's become a memorable part of my travel story. Despite this culinary mishap, my time in Laos was enriching and full of unique experiences. From the charming flight to the awe-inspiring waterfalls and the quirky market, every moment added to the tapestry of my journey.

As I left Luang Prabang for [Chiang Mai, Thailand]({% post_url 2017/2017-08-21-thailand %}), I carried with me the memories of a country that, while not as internationally renowned for its cuisine, offers a wealth of natural beauty and cultural richness.
