There’s something enchantingly timeless about Myanmar. Even before touching down in Mandalay, I could sense the country's rich tapestry of history and culture waiting to unfold. Karen and I had both flown in from [Chiang Mai, Thailand]({% post_url 2017/2017-08-21-thailand %}), and were eager to start our exploration.

## Mandalay: The Cultural Heartbeat

Our adventure kicked off in Mandalay, a city that’s often described as the cultural heartbeat of Myanmar. From the moment we arrived, the city's vibrant energy was palpable. We hired a local driver who would be our guide through the maze of temples, pagodas, and bustling markets. Our first stop was the Mahamuni Pagoda, home to one of the most revered Buddha images in the country. The air was thick with the scent of incense and the hum of prayers, a deeply spiritual experience that set the tone for our journey.

One of the highlights was climbing Mandalay Hill. It's a bit of a hike, with what feels like a thousand stairs, but the panoramic view from the top is worth every step. You get a 360-degree view of the city and the surrounding landscape, a sea of green punctuated by golden spires. As we wandered through the hilltop pagodas, each more intricate than the last, I couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of peace.

## The U Bein Bridge: A Walk Through History

Next, we made our way to the U Bein Bridge, believed to be the oldest and longest teakwood bridge in the world. Built in 1850, this bridge stretches across Taungthaman Lake and is a marvel of engineering and history. Walking across it, you can't help but be transported back in time. The bridge was bustling with locals and tourists alike, each taking in the serene beauty of the lake and the surrounding countryside. Despite the crowds, there was a certain tranquility to the place, a reminder of Myanmar's enduring charm.

## Bagan: A Sea of Pagodas

From Mandalay, we drove to Bagan, a place that defies description. Imagine over 3,000 ancient pagodas and temples spread across a vast plain, each one a testament to Myanmar's rich history. We arrived just in time for sunset, and seeing the pagodas bathed in the golden light of dusk was a sight I'll never forget. The next morning, we woke up early to catch the sunrise and watch the hot air balloons take flight over the landscape. It was like stepping into a different world, one where time stood still.

We spent our days in Bagan exploring the temples, each one unique in its architecture and history. From the massive Ananda Temple to the smaller, less-visited pagodas, every corner of Bagan held a new discovery. One of the most memorable experiences was visiting the Shwezigon Pagoda, a stunning structure covered in gold leaf. The way it glimmered in the sunlight was nothing short of magical.

## Local Flavors and Surprises

Food in Myanmar was a mixed bag. While I found the local cuisine to be less impressive compared to its Southeast Asian neighbors, there were still some culinary gems. In Bagan, after a few disappointing meals, I stumbled upon an Italian restaurant run by an actual Italian chef. It was a surprising find, but the food was excellent, a welcome break from the local fare. The Valpolicella wine was a treat, and it made for a memorable dining experience.

## The Betel Nut Experience

One of the more curious local customs I encountered was the chewing of betel nut. It's a common practice in Myanmar, and you see it everywhere. The betel leaf, combined with lime and betel nut, often includes shattered glass to enhance the effect. Chewing it turns your spit a bright red and is terrible for your teeth. I tried it once, but quickly spat it out. The taste was less than pleasant, and I didn't feel any of the supposed effects.

## Farewell Myanmar

Our journey through Myanmar was a whirlwind of temples, culture, and unforgettable experiences. As we made our way back to Mandalay for our flight out, I couldn't help but feel a sense of longing to return. There's so much more to explore, and despite the challenges, Myanmar's beauty and history left a lasting impression on me.

From the bustling streets of Mandalay to the serene pagodas of Bagan, Myanmar is a country that stays with you long after you've left. It’s a place where time seems to stand still, and every corner holds a new story waiting to be discovered. As I boarded my flight to the next destination, I knew that Myanmar had carved out a special place in my heart, one that I hope to revisit in the future.
