After wrapping up an exhilarating time in [Ho Chi Minh City]({% post_url 2017/2017-08-02-hanoi %}), I was ready for the next leg of my Southeast Asian adventure: Cambodia. Specifically, the ancient city of Siem Reap, home to the iconic Angkor Wat. Little did I know, this journey would be filled with unexpected encounters, culinary delights, and unforgettable experiences.

## Arrival in Siem Reap

Touching down in Siem Reap, I felt a wave of excitement mixed with a bit of fatigue. My hostel, a cozy little spot whose name escapes me, was the perfect place to recharge. After a quick nap, I woke up to an empty dorm room and a gnawing curiosity about what the city had to offer. I turned to Couchsurfing, hoping to find some fellow travelers or locals to hang out with. That's when I stumbled upon Fortunata, a vibrant soul with South American roots but living in Italy. We decided to meet at a nearby café.

As we chatted over coffee, another Couchsurfing notification popped up—a local guy offering to show us around. His profile said he was a taxi driver, which sounded a bit sketchy, but Fortunata convinced me to give it a shot. "Don't be so German," she said, laughing at my cautious nature.

## An Unexpected Dinner

We met our local guide outside the café. He insisted we get into his car, which made me even more uneasy. But Fortunata's adventurous spirit was infectious, so I swallowed my doubts and hopped in. We drove out of the city, into what felt like the middle of nowhere, until we arrived at what appeared to be a brothel. My heart raced, but our guide assured us it was the best restaurant around.

Despite my initial misgivings, the food was incredible—two whole fish, a variety of grilled meats, and an array of vegetables. The service was impeccable, with a waitress topping up my beer every time I took a sip. The bill? Just $12. Our guide even insisted on splitting it, leaving me both bewildered and relieved.

## Angkor Wat: A Temple of Wonders

The next morning, we set off early for Angkor Wat. The queue was manageable, and soon we were exploring the sprawling temple complex. Words can't do justice to the grandeur of Angkor Wat; it's something you have to experience firsthand. The intricate carvings, towering spires, and ancient ruins transport you to another era.

One of my favorite spots was the older temple where they filmed "Tomb Raider." The massive trees with roots snaking through the stone structures made for some incredible photos. It felt like stepping into a real-life adventure game.

## New Friendships and Culinary Adventures

At Angkor Wat, I met Hama, a fellow traveler going through a tough year. We hit it off immediately and made plans to explore Siem Reap together. That evening, we found ourselves at a unique restaurant run by a French chef who specialized in dishes made from insects. From fried spiders to water cockroaches, it was a culinary adventure unlike any other. The chef explained that he wasn't doing it for the novelty; he genuinely believed insects were the protein source of the future.

Later that night, we met more travelers, including a Chinese guy named Hao, who would later visit me in Berlin. We also met Karen, and together we explored the vibrant nightlife of Siem Reap. The city's famous walking street was packed with backpackers, street food vendors, and lively bars. We took countless photos, laughed a lot, and made memories that would last a lifetime.

## A Life-Changing Invitation

As the night wound down, Hama extended an invitation that would change my life. "You should come visit me in Singapore. I have a big place; you can stay with me." At the time, I thought it was one of those things people say but never follow through on. Little did I know, this casual invitation would lead to a new chapter in my life, as detailed in episode three of my podcast "[Sleepless in Singapore](https://www.sleepless.sg/)".

Moving on from Siem Reap, I left for [Laos]({% post_url 2017/2017-08-16-laos %}), carrying with me the memories of a city that had surprised me in the best possible way. Siem Reap wasn't just about temples and history; it was about the people I met, the food I tried, and the friendships I forged. It was a reminder that the best adventures often begin with a leap of faith and a willingness to embrace the unexpected.
