After a whirlwind journey through [Cambodia]({% post_url 2017/2017-08-13-siemreap %}) and [Laos]({% post_url 2017/2017-08-16-laos %}), I found myself on a plane heading to Thailand, specifically Chiang Mai. This northern gem of Thailand was a refreshing change from the tropical islands and bustling cities I had previously explored. Nestled in the jungle, Chiang Mai offered a cooler climate and a unique charm that captivated me immediately.

## Chiang Mai: A Refreshing Escape

Chiang Mai's cooler temperatures were a welcome relief from the sweltering heat of southern Thailand. The city, surrounded by lush greenery and hills, had a laid-back vibe that made it an ideal place to unwind. I stayed in a cozy hostel, which provided a perfect base for my adventures.

One of the highlights of my stay in Chiang Mai was reconnecting with Karen, whom I had briefly met in Cambodia. We decided to explore the city together, starting with a visit to the vibrant local markets. The markets in Chiang Mai are a sensory overload, with stalls selling everything from fresh produce to handmade crafts. We indulged in some delicious street food, including the famous Khao Soi, a rich and creamy coconut curry noodle soup that quickly became one of my favorite Thai dishes.

## Elephant Encounters

Our next adventure took us to the Rantong Elephant Safe and Rescue Center. We had done our research and chose this sanctuary because it promised ethical treatment of the elephants, with no riding involved. Spending time with these majestic creatures was a humbling experience. We fed them, bathed them in a muddy pool, and even had a baby elephant wrap its trunk around my neckâ€”a moment both thrilling and slightly nerve-wracking.

## Onsen Eggs and Cliff Jumping

One day, we decided to hike to a nearby park known for its hot springs. Here, I tried my hand at making onsen eggs. The process involved placing eggs in a basket on a stick and immersing them in the hot spring water for about 40 minutes. The result was perfectly cooked eggs with a creamy texture, a delightful snack after our hike.

Later that day, we visited an old quarry filled with water, where we could cliff jump from various heights. While I chickened out from the highest jump, Karen bravely took the plunge. Watching her leap from such a height was exhilarating, and I was content to cheer her on from the safety of solid ground.

## The Long Neck Karen Village

Another fascinating stop was the Long Neck Karen Village. The women of this tribe are known for wearing brass rings around their necks, gradually adding more rings as they grow older. This practice elongates their necks, creating a striking and unique appearance. Visiting the village was a cultural eye-opener, and we spent time learning about their traditions and way of life.

## The Winding Road to Pai

From Chiang Mai, we decided to take a mini-van to Pai, a small town known for its scenic beauty and vibrant nightlife. The road to Pai is infamous for its countless twists and turns, making it a thrilling yet stomach-churning journey. Despite the challenging drive, Pai's charm made it worth the effort. The town had a laid-back, hippie vibe, with plenty of live music, art galleries, and cozy cafes to explore.

The next day, we rented motorbikes and set off to explore the surrounding countryside. The lush green hills, picturesque waterfalls, and hidden hot springs made for a memorable day of adventure.

I left for [Myanmar]({% post_url 2017/2017-08-27-myanmar %}) with a heart full of memories and a camera full of photos.
