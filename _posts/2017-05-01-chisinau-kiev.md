title: From Chișinău to Kiev
---


It is April the 30th, ten days in, when we arrive [from Moldova](/?p=786) in Kiev. We have a lovely Airbnb, managed by Kolya, Airbnb-Manager and elf, according to his own words. Kolya welcomes us, has a lot of tips – and then shows us the rooftop of his building. When we were thinking "rooftop terrace" first, we realize very soon it is really just rooftop. No railings, no nothing – above the 12th floor. We feel a little like those jumpers you might know from youtube videos. Excited, but also a little afraid. Kolya is climbing around in dizzying heights; we stick more to the center.

At night we eat at [Pervak](http://www.pervak.kiev.ua/). A funny experience. It is supposed to be the best restaurant in Kiev. And the food is good, in fact. The waitresses are dressed like nurses. Busty nurses, to be precise. When ordering the homemade ginger lemonade, our waiter advises against and recommends the regular lemonade. He is wrong. While the regular tastes like liquid gummi bears, the ginger one is actually quite likable. Tired we go to bed.

Our breakfast we have at [The Blue Cup Coffee Shop](https://www.facebook.com/TheBlueCupCoffee/). I have some kind of eggs benedict, Philipp has pancakes. It is very good.

During the day we do a lot of sightseeing. There is the [Saint Sophia's Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Sophia%27s_Cathedral,_Kiev), which is stunning, a huge park, a left outdoor theater, a cable car, the [Kiev Monastery of the Caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev%5C_Pechersk%5C_Lavra), which is a must – local people kiss the coffins for luck – and finally there is, like in every city, a burger place we try. On our way back we walk along a big magnificent street, with markets and really a lot of people. It is the European Song Contest, apparently.

Back at our place – we stayed only for two days – when we pick up our luggage, we meet two young girls. One of them asks us in very perfect but also very unusual German:

> "If you would excuse me please, I wish a pleasant morning, gentlemen. May I humbly ask for your names, Sir?"
>
> "Ahm ... hi, I'm Julian?"
>
> "Oh, I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Sir!"
>
> "Ok ... ah ... thank you. Same here. Why do you speak German so well?"
>
> "We have performed traditional dances in Bremen, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart. We are natives of Minsk. It is in Belarus."
>
> "Ok, cool. Sadly we have to leave now, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy your time and take care!
>
> "We are most blessed to have met you, Sires, good bye!"

Wasn't that a weird but nice incident.

We take an Uber to the train station. It costs almost nothing. A corpulent Russian lady we ask for the way practically tears our tickets from my hands and walks away very quickly. We follow very quickly. She only stops at a – to us – random track and commands us to a – to us – very random section. There are no markings whatsoever, but it is precisely where our door is after the train arrives. It is a very full train and we have to sleep in the top bunks. But we are so tired that we quickly fall asleep on our way to Moscow.
