## An Early Start to Safari Adventures

Our journey to Kenya's safari began with an early morning wake-up call at 5 a.m., following the last event of a wedding we were attending. Without the usual morning preparations or breakfast, we quickly left the hotel amidst a minor hiccup with the hotel's billing system. Our friend Hatim managed to resolve the confusion, allowing us to depart for the train station in Mombasa on time.

The process at the train station was unexpectedly rigorous, resembling airport security protocols with multiple luggage checks. Here, we encountered a small issue with a pocket knife I had in my luggage, which was resolved by Hatim through a small, friendly transaction with the security personnel. An interesting glimpse into local practices.

Boarding the train to Voi, we were pleasantly surprised by its comfort and the level of service, marking a stark contrast to the rugged adventure awaiting us. The journey was smooth, with the train staff ensuring cleanliness and comfort throughout the ride. This train ride, blending modern conveniences with the anticipation of the wild adventures ahead, was the beginning of our unforgettable journey into Kenya's heartland.

## Embracing the Wild

Our arrival at the safari camp was like stepping into a different world. Greeted with eucalyptus-scented towels and breathtaking views, the camp was a haven in the heart of the savannah. Our tents, luxurious and well-appointed, offered the perfect blend of adventure and comfort. The highlight, however, was the wildlife. From the majestic elephants to the elusive leopards, each sighting was a reminder of nature's wonders.

The game drives through Tsavo National Park were exhilarating. Zebras casually grazing by the roadside, giraffes emerging from the bushes, and a family of elephants at a watering hole were sights that no zoo could replicate. The vastness of the park, coupled with the diversity of its inhabitants, made each moment unforgettable.

## A 5-star tent

The camp, set amidst the untamed beauty of the Kenyan savannah, offered an unexpected luxury that contrasted sharply with the rugged wilderness surrounding us. Our accommodations, though termed "tents," were anything but the basic shelter one might expect in the heart of the wild. These tents were spacious, with elegant furnishings that melded modern comforts with the essence of nature, ensuring a stay that was as comfortable as it was authentic.

Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the camp staff with refreshments and cold, eucalyptus-scented towels—a small but thoughtful gesture that was much appreciated after our journey through the dusty savannah. The camp itself was designed to maximize our connection with the natural world, featuring an open dining area where we could dine under the stars and a pool that offered panoramic views of the sprawling landscape.

Daniel, the camp chef, was a character in his own right. With the flair of a seasoned entertainer, he introduced each meal with a short speech, imbuing the dining experience with a sense of occasion. His culinary skills were evident in every dish served, from hearty breakfasts to sumptuous dinners, each meal was a delightful exploration of local flavors and ingredients. Daniel's presentations added an unexpected layer of enjoyment to our dining experiences, making each meal ... wait for it ... memorable.

Our days were filled with game drives that brought us face-to-face with the incredible biodiversity of Tsavo National Park. The thrill of spotting zebras, giraffes, and elephants in their natural habitat was unparalleled. The guides, knowledgeable and passionate about wildlife conservation, provided insights that enriched our understanding of the ecosystem and the challenges it faces.

Evenings at the camp were a time for relaxation and reflection. The clear night skies, untainted by light pollution, offered a stunning backdrop for our conversations, with the Milky Way visible in all its glory.

The camp was not just a place to stay; it was an integral part of our safari experience. It provided a comfortable base from which we could explore the wild beauty of Kenya, a place where we could unwind and reflect on the day's adventures. The seamless blend of luxury and nature, along with the warm hospitality of the staff, made our stay at the camp an unforgettable part of our Kenyan adventure.

## We're on Party-Safari

Upon reaching Tsavo National Park, we were eager to delve into the heart of Kenya's wilderness, yet our enthusiasm was momentarily dampened by unexpected complications at the entrance. The park's procedures, akin to a digital fortress, required online payments that proved to be a hurdle with our non-local credit cards. Despite several attempts across multiple cards, the system stubbornly refused our transactions. This delay, extending over an hour, was a test of patience. Ultimately, through a combination of local assistance and inventive problem-solving, we managed to navigate this bureaucratic maze though.

Inside Tsavo, the inconvenience at the gate quickly faded into insignificance against the backdrop of the park's stunning landscapes and diverse wildlife. Our first encounters - zebras and giraffes casually grazing, their presence both surreal and grounding, set the tone for the safari. The park, vast and untamed, was a living canvas, each turn revealing new wonders. Elephants, in their majestic tranquility, crossed our path regularly and deer was basically omnipresent.

The safari days were filled with moments of awe and serenity, hand in hand with humorous occations – for example our girls finding themselves in need amidst the vast savannah, opting for the shelter of a roundabout's center for a brief respite. Check out my Instagram for pix.

## A Brief Respite on Chale Island

After the exhilarating safari experience in Tsavo, our next destination offered a tranquil contrast. Chale Island, a slice of paradise nestled off the coast of Mombasa, welcomed us with its pristine waters and peaceful atmosphere. The island's unique charm was encapsulated in our accommodation, a quaint tower room that boasted panoramic views of the surrounding ocean.

Our days on Chale Island unfolded in leisurely bliss, with much of our time spent at the resort's stunning pool which offered an endless view of the ocean horizon. The poolside became our sanctuary, where the hours slipped by unnoticed as we indulged in the luxury of relaxation. The highlight was Kenya's national cocktail, the Dawa. This refreshing blend of vodka, honey, lime, and crushed ice, served right in the pool, became the embodiment of our laid-back island lifestyle.

As the sun began its descent, we were introduced to the island's sundowner spot, an experience that was a highlight of our evenings. Nestled on a secluded part of the island, this location featured nets strung over the water, where we could lie back and immerse ourselves in the tranquility of the moment. Accompanied by a selection of snacks and the soft glow of the setting sun, it was a place of pure relaxation and reflection.

Chale Island provided a perfect balance to our Kenyan journey, offering a peaceful retreat where time seemed to stand still.

## A Whirlwind Tour of Dubai

Our return journey through Dubai was a stark contrast to the natural beauty of Kenya. The city's architectural marvels, from the towering Burj Khalifa to the opulent Burj Al Arab, showcased human ingenuity. Our day was packed with sightseeing, from the historic alleys of Old Town to the glittering Gold Souq. The culmination of our journey in Dubai's bustling metropolis was a fitting end to our adventure, bridging the gap between the serene and the spectacular.

## A long way home

The long journey back home offered one last glance at Kenya's diverse landscapes, a bittersweet farewell to a country that had given us so many unforgettable memories. Before heading to the airport, we seized the opportunity for some last-minute souvenir shopping. It was here that I stumbled upon Master Chum Chum, a quaint wooden carving that immediately caught my eye.

The flight back to Dubai with flydubai fell short of our expectations. A last-minute aircraft change meant that the upgraded seats we had anticipated were replaced with ones lacking the comfort and amenities we had hoped for. This, coupled with the challenge of trying to rest on an overnight flight, added a note of discomfort to our return journey.

Arriving in Dubai, we were determined to make the most of our day-long layover. Despite our tiredness, we embarked on a whirlwind tour of the city's iconic sights. From the architectural marvel of the Burj Khalifa to the luxury of the Burj Al Arab, and the bustling atmosphere of the Dubai Marina, each landmark offered a glimpse into the city's blend of modernity and tradition. Our highlight, foodies that we are, was lunch at a renowned ramen spot, where the flavors transported us momentarily back to Asia, a fitting precursor to our return home.

The sightseeing continued with visits to the Dubai Frame and various souks, immersing ourselves in the city's vibrant culture and history. As the day drew to a close, we found ourselves at the airport once again, this time preparing for our flight back to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. The journey back was a stark contrast to our previous flight, marked by the exceptional service and comfort that Singapore Airlines is known for. Landing in Singapore at the break of dawn, we were home within an hour, a smooth and fitting end to our adventure.
