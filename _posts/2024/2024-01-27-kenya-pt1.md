Why Kenya, you ask? Imagine receiving a wedding invitation that not only promises love and festivities but also an adventure across continents. That was precisely the case for us when Hatim, Canadian by passport but Indian by heritage and residing in Kenya, announced his wedding. The thought alone was enough to pique our curiosity and set us on a journey from Singapore to the heart of Africa.

(For those intrigued by the intricacies and behind-the-scenes tales of our Kenyan adventure, my podcast "[Sleepless in Singapore](https://www.sleepless.sg)" features a [Kenya episode](https://www.sleepless.sg/5) where I dive a bit deeper.)

## The Journey Begins: Flight Frenzy and Dubai Detours

Embarking on this trip was no small feat. Direct flights were a dream too far-fetched, leading us into the labyrinth of flight research — a task I hadn't tackled in years, thanks to the convenience of Singapore Airlines and my stash of miles. However, necessity reigns supreme, and soon I found myself juggling between [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.com.sg) and [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights), hunting for the perfect itinerary. Our chosen route? Singapore to Dubai on Singapore Airlines, a brief layover filled with sightseeing, followed by a flight with flydubai to Mombasa, and finally, a domestic hop to Nairobi with Kenya Airways.

Dubai, our layover city, was a blend of opulence and chaos. The vast airport, the cumbersome immigration queues, and the lengthy wait for a taxi contrasted sharply with the welcoming gesture of a free SIM card loaded with data — a small but significant relief for any traveler.

Adding to the mosaic of our Dubai experience was an odd encounter at the [Le Meridian](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/dxbmd-le-meridien-dubai-hotel-and-conference-centre/photos/), a supposed sanctuary of luxury. Our request for a simple paper napkin to wrap a half-eaten pastry was met with a baffling denial. The waitress informed us, with an air of finality, that taking food outside was against hotel policy, except, inexplicably, for the ill. This small but surreal interaction, far from ruining our mood, added a layer of humor to our layover tales, illustrating that even in the most prestigious of establishments, the unexpected awaits.

## Kenya Calls: Weddings, Wildlife, and Wonders

Arriving in Nairobi, the anticipation of finally meeting up with Mera and Marty gave us an adrenaline rush. It felt like no time had passed when we saw them waiting for us at the [Glam Hotel](https://www.glamhotel.co.ke). Their hugs were as warm as the Kenyan sun, and the laughter and catching up began immediately.

At this first night we found ourselves at the [Carnivore Restaurant](https://tamarind.co.ke/carnivore/), a place that's all about the meat. Imagine a barbecue on steroids, and you're halfway there. This isn't just any dining spot; it's a carnivore's dream come true, where skewers of meat are paraded around as if on a victory lap, each cut more succulent than the last. From the conventional beef and chicken to the more adventurous game meats, it's an all-you-can-eat feast that tests the limits of your appetite. If you are particulary adventuresome, try the bulls balls. Yes, I'm talking testicles here. (And if you are not: Ask Mera!) The atmosphere? Pure joy and hearty laughter, as we signaled 'yes' for more with the drop of a flag.

And at night, Christian and Melina joined the group, injecting fresh excitement into our already vibrant gathering.

The next day, among the myriad of wonders Kenya unfurled before us, a visit to the [Nairobi Giraffe Centre](https://www.giraffecentre.org) stood out as a moment of sheer enchantment. Here, in the gentle company of these towering yet graceful beings, we discovered a peculiar marvel: the antiseptic properties of giraffe tongues. As we fed them, their long, rough tongues grazed our hands, a sensation as surprising as it was fascinating. This encounter was not just a brush with wildlife but a lesson in the delicate balance of nature, where even a giraffe's lick carries the healing touch of the wild.

## Lessons in Patience: African Indian Timing

Landing in Mombasa was like stepping into a novel filled with vibrant characters and picturesque settings. The wedding was nothing short of spectacular, blending Indian traditions with African warmth in a celebration that spanned several days. From color ceremonies to henna tattoos, each event was a testament to cultural fusion and familial bonds. Definitely not always on time – but mostly worth our time.

Not all was smooth sailing, however. The concept of "African Indian timing" tested our patience, with schedules stretching and twisting in ways that could frustrate even the most seasoned traveler. Being late for your own wedding? Totally acceptable here. Yet, this too became a cherished part of our adventure, teaching us to embrace the unexpected with humor and grace. I couldn't help but make light of the situation, joking that "everything is 20 minutes" became our mantra, regardless of whether it was actually a five-minute walk or an hour-long drive.

Our stay at the "[Sun 'n Sands Hotel](https://sunnsand.co.ke)" in Mombasa was an experience in itself. While the hotel was just shaking off the cobwebs of a COVID-induced hiatus, it served as our base for the whirlwind of wedding festivities. It wasn't just about attending a wedding; it was about immersing ourselves in a vibrant confluence of cultures, a sensory overload that I hadn't anticipated but wholly embraced.

## Sailing into the Sunset: Boat Rides and Beachside Bliss

One of the trip's highlights was a serene boat ride, a moment of tranquility that balanced the whirlwind of activities. As we glided towards the sunset, the worries of the world seemed to dissolve into the waters below, leaving us with a sense of peace and contentment.

## A home away from home

The climax, however, was our time at Hatim's home. The warmth and hospitality we received from Hatim's lovely mom and the whole family were unparalleled. We were treated to an array of Indian dishes that tantalized our taste buds, a feast that felt both exotic and comforting. The color ceremony, a spectacle of hues and laughter, left us covered in shades of joy – and Hatim covered in shades of yellow. The henna ceremony added another layer to this rich tapestry of traditions. Watching the intricate patterns take shape on the ladies' hands was mesmerizing, a beautiful blend of art and ritual that spoke volumes of the culture we were momentarily part of. These experiences, set against the backdrop of Hatim's welcoming home, were a poignant reminder of the beauty of coming together, of celebrating love in all its forms, in a setting that was as heartwarming as it was splendid.

## 15 minutes of fame

Nat had already orchestrated much of the wedding, infusing the events with dances, games, and a whole lot of fun. Yet, it was the evening she stepped up as MC that left me beaming with pride. There she stood, effortlessly navigating the night's festivities, showcasing a talent I didn't know of, a talent that seemed second nature to her. She led a Q&A game where the newly weds, Mubi and Hatim, had to match their answers without seeing each other – questions like "Who's the tougher one?" and "Who's more romantic?" elicited responses that were both revealing and amusing. Then there was the bingo game, designed to engage everyone in attendance, creating an atmosphere of communal joy and laughter.

Indeed, Nat's performance was so stellar that I half-joked about getting her to team up with our newfound friends, Jenny and Manny — the latter being a producer for [renowned Austrian TV shows](https://www.atv.at/tv/amore-unter-palmen). Despite my enthusiasm, Nat remains modestly hesitant about embracing her newfound calling.

For me, that night wrapped up perfectly as I found myself and Christian stepping aside onto a terrace, away from the crowd. There, against the backdrop of a starlit sky, we shared a drink and delved into one of those rare, meandering conversations that only best friends can have — spanning everything and nothing all at once. It was one of those moments that encapsulate the essence of friendship, set against the vibrant tapestry of a night to remember.

## The Safari and Beyond: A Tease of Adventures Unfolded

As the wedding part of our Kenyan journey concluded, we were left with memories to last a lifetime and stories to fill countless evenings. Yet, there's more to tell — safaris that brought us face-to-face with the wild heart of Africa, a secluded island that offered a slice of paradise, and a return to Dubai for a day of exploration.

But that is for another time.
